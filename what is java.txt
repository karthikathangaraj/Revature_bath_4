Memory mangemenrt gargabe collection 
jvm is platform dependent



ByteCode:
Java source code is compiled into bytecode by the javac compiler. Bytecode is an intermediate representation of the code that is not machine-specific but rather designed to be executed by the JVM. 
Grabage Collecetions:
Java includes an automatic memory management system known as garbage collection.
Class Libraries:
